Installing the N-Gram Processor
===============================


To install, type the following commands in a terminal window while in the ngramprocessor directory:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The last command requires administrative privileges, so it might need to be
be run as 'sudo make install', for example on Mac OS. This installs the files
in the standard locations. For more information see the PDF-manual.

The N-Gram Processor requires Perl version 5.8.5 or later and the shell scripts included require the bash shell.
