In December 2005, Sunrise aired a special episode that remade the events from the series' last episode. A series of four films compilating the series has also been released in Japan. "Gundam SEED" was adapted into various manga adaptations and light novels published by Kodansha and Kadokawa Shoten. Bandai Entertainment licensed the series for North America release, and has published it in DVD volumes. Some episodes also aired in Canada, while the compilations films were also released in DVDs. The first manga was licensed and published by Del Rey Manga. Various types of merchandising have also been released, including CD soundtracks and video games.
"Gundam SEED Destiny" became highly popular in Japan, having sold over one million DVD volumes and soundtracks topping charts. The series was also the winner of the Anime Grand Prix in both 2004 and 2005 polls. Critical reception has also been positive with focus on the themes and events occurring throughout the series. However, "Gundam SEED Destiny" has often been compared with its prequel for sharing similar situations with the director's cut OVA having helped to improve an ending that was felt weak.
Plot.
"Gundam SEED Destiny" sets the story two years after the original series and it starts when the leader from Orb, Cagalli Yula Athha, reunites with PLANT's chairman Gilbert Durandal to discuss the construction of new mobile suits made for the military organization ZAFT. Three of them are stolen by a group called Phantom Pain, which is controlled by the Blue Cosmos terrorist organization. Cagalli's bodyguard Athrun Zala joins ZAFT pilot Shinn Asuka to stop them. During the fight, ZAFT's battleship Minerva is ordered to destroy the ruins of a space colony to prevent it from crashing into Earth. They find out that rogue ZAFT soldiers are controlling the colony in order to crash it into Earth. After failing to completely destroy the colony, a second war starts between the factions, the Earth Alliance and ZAFT, once news has spread that ZAFT soldiers caused the colony to collide on Earth. The neutral country of Orb allies with the Earth Alliance, with the former having also joined Blue Cosmos. This leads these three faction to confront the ZAFT soldiers several times, with Athrun having returned there.
Later in the war, the Archangel class assault ship interferes in the fights between ZAFT and the Earth Alliance's faction. Allied with the Archangel, Cagalli fails to stop her country from fighting and the Archangel is involved in the fight. Athrun becomes disaffected after Gilbert Durandal orders the destruction of his friend Kira Yamato and the Archangel, deeming them as enemies. He defects with Meyrin Hawke when Durandal frames him as a traitor. Cagalli is able to regain leadership from Orb, causing the Blue Cosmos' members to defect to space. The leader of Blue Cosmos, Lord Djibril, orders the weapon Requiem to be fired which destroys many of the space colonies of PLANT, resulting in many deaths. The crew of the Minerva successfully kills Lord Djibril and capture the Requiem. Gilbert Durandal then announces the "Destiny Plan", a plan where a person's job or task will be based on their genetics, and uses the Requiem to destroy anyone who opposes him. This brings Shinn and the crew of the Minerva into direct conflict with the Archangel ship and the ZAFT forces opposing. Kira and Athrun with their new mobile suits ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom and ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice respectively and their allies, defeat the ZAFT forces and destroy the Requiem. Durandal is killed by one of his own followers, Rey Za Burrel. 
The series' ending was expanded in both the original video animation and the last compilation film. Soon after Durandal's death, the Earth Alliance, ZAFT, and the Orb Union meet to end the war, with Lacus Clyne acting as the negotiator. After fighting between each other various time in their mobile suits, Kira and Shinn meet in person for the first time and promise to join forces for a better future.
Production.
"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" was first announced in July 2004 in Japanese magazines. Earlier, voice actor Seki Tomokazu had stated he was working on a popular show with fans hinting it was related to "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED". Next month, the first trailer from the series was hosted online in its official website. Before the series' premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn's character, telling that the "Gundam SEED Destiny"s protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance. The main staff from "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED" remained in "Gundam SEED Destiny" including director Mitsuo Fukuda. When the series was premiering in Japan, Fukuda stated that unlike "Gundam SEED", the sequel would not focus on Kira's and Athrun's relationship, but on Shinn's involvement in the war. He addressed that such conflict would happen in the series, but refrained from giving its reasons. In order to add more entertainment to the series, the staff also worked on the fight scenes between mobile suits. Shinn's character was meant to contrast Kira's in regards to their involvement across the series, but as Kira did, he would also go through a major development.

Reception.
The series has been highly popular in Japan, having won the "Animage" Anime Grand Prix awards for best anime in the 2004 and 2005 polls. In both of these polls, Athrun Zala, Kira Yamato and Lacus Clyne have also topped the most popular characters categories, with the last episode and the OVA also occupying their own category. DVD sales have been good, with various of them appearing in official Japanese rankings. In November 2005, Bandai Visual announced that "Gundam SEED Destiny" had sold over one million DVD volumes in Japan. Soundtracks have also been popular with both themes from T.M. Revolution and Nami Tamaki topping Oricon charts during their release. In the Recording Industry Association of Japan's awards, "Gundam SEED Destiny" was the winner in the category of animation album. In the Anime Nation's top selling DVDs, the twelveth "Gundam SEED Destiny" volume ranked ninth.
Critical reception for "Gundam SEED Destiny" has been positive but it was often compared with "Gundam SEED". "Gundam SEED"s backstory was noted to be essential for the plot of "Gundam SEED Destiny" to the point that Maria Lin considered that it was required to watch the former to fully understand the series. The new cast of characters was well-received with the relationship between Rey Za Burrel and Neo Larronoke bringing speculations regarding their identites due to how it mirrored one from "Gundam SEED". However, initial reaction to lead character Shinn Asuka has been mixed due to his antagonistic personality and how some of the new and returning characters overshadowed his role in the series. While at some points Shinn's role and relationships were found entertaining, UK Anime's Ross Liversidge liked how returning character Kira Yamato took bigger role in the series. However, Chris Guanche, Editor-in-Chief of Mecha Anime HQ, wrote early on his reviews of the series that he would have preferred to see some kind of balance between the old and new characters and hoped that Fukuda would not end up "sidelining" the new ones. Guanche was more critical to the series considering the way the ending was exceuted. 
Still, the themes from the series have also been praised for being entertaining and debatable despite also sharing it with other Gundam series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment further commented on this, stating that while it brings parallels other series, "Gundam SEED Destiny"s themes are "also done well enough that it stands firmly on its own." The last episodes were criticized for bringing situations similar to the ones from the ending of "Gundam SEED". In contrast, the fight scenes occurrying in these episodes were praised alongside the emotional impact brought by some scenes. The OVA repraising the events from the series' last episode was praised for explaining events from "Gundam SEED Destiny" such as Gilbert Durandal's discussions with Rau Le Creuset. It was also noted make a more satisfying ending, allowing to develop more of their characters with the emotional focus being more explored than in the television series' finale. Guanche agreed that it was a better ending than the last episode but said it was still weak.
The series' animation was highly praised for the coloring and character designs. The mobile suits' designs have been well-received despite the fact they transformed, something considered cheesy by Anime News Network's Paul Fargo. The fight scenes were also noted to be the main focus from the televisions series' last episodes, as they brought entertaining action scenes with the new mechas introduced. However, the OVA was noted to downplay these scenes, with some of them being hard to fully understand. Soundtracks also had praise for bringing enjoyable themes and the return from Nami Tamaki. Fargo stated that composer Toshihiko Sahashi notably improved his scores from "Gundam SEED", with artists' opening and ending themes also being entertaining. The Japanese voice was noted to bring popular idols such as Maaya Sakamoto, resulting in an enjoyable one. On the other hand, response to the English casting was mixed with some actors making appealing portrayals while in other cases poor ones. Nevertheless, Don Houston from DVD Talk advised viewers to listen to the English dub rather than the original Japanese version, having noticed that some sound effects were remixed and thus improved the audio.
