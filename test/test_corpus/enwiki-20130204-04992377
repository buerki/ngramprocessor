Pretty Cure Splash Star

, often shortened simply to "Pretty Cure Splash★Star" or "PreCure Splash★Star", is a magical girl anime series produced by Toei Animation and Asahi Broadcasting Corporation, which aired in Japan Animax, TV Asahi and Asahi Broadcasting Corporation between February 5, 2006 and January 28, 2007. It is the third series in Izumi Todo's "Pretty Cure" franchise, following a new story different from the previous two series. The series is directed by Toshiaki Komura, who previously directed Kinnikuman Nisei. The character designs were done by Akira Inagami, who previously worked on the character designs on both Futari Wa Pretty Cure and Futari Wa Pretty Cure: Max Heart. The series's theme and concept is based on the Japanese idiom , which symbolizes the beauties of Nature, or the traditional themes of natural beauty in Japanese aesthetics.
Plot.
Saki Hyuuga and Mai Mishou met at age nine for the first time after they followed two glowing balls that flew towards the Sky Tree, a big tree situated on top of a mountain in their town. Five years later, they met again at the same place and became the new legendary warriors PreCure (Pretty Cure). Flappy and Choppy, spirits from the Land of Fountains, revealed that they were the glowing balls and the girls were chosen to protect the Fountain of Sun hidden in Saki and Mai's world, which they refer to as the Land of Greenery. Saki and Mai are transformed into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret using the spirits. Later they are upgraded to Cure Bright and Cure Windy with help from two additional spirits Mupu and Fupu. The villains of this series are the Dark Fall, who are searching for the Fountain of Sun, the last of the seven fountains that feed the World Tree - the source of all life forms for all worlds. The Leader of the Dark Fall has set his aim on this tree, and it is Pretty Cure's job to protect it.
In the "Splash★Star" movie, Sirlion, a warrior from Dark Fall, opens up a gateway to the Land of Clocks using directions from Mai. His plan to dominate the world is to halt the Eternal (Infinite) Clock and freeze time, cutting off everyone's future. Saki and Mai were already in disagreement after Saki overslept and Mai wandered off into a nearby clock store, causing them to miss the sign-up for the karaoke singing contest. After being thrown into an endless maze, Saki and Mai have to work in unison if they want to solve the puzzle.

Special powers and items.
Similar to the preceding series, Saki and Mai must transform together into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret (later into Cure Bright and Cure Windy) in order to access their fighting powers. To do so, they insert a pair of Pretty Cure Diamond Cards into the disc of the Mix Commune, spin it, and shout out "Dual Spiritual Power!" Unlike the preceding series, the girls speak an additional incantation speech in the midst of their transformation process; namely, "Bloom (Open a flower) on the earth!" for Saki and "Soar (Flap your wings) into the sky!" for Mai. The girls' gloves are revealed when they say these respective speeches. Cure Bloom is blessed with the flower power from the earth and emits a golden aura. Cure Egret gets her bird power from the sky and has a bluish silvery aura.
Like the preceding series, the girls also shout a challenge phrase after their self introduction. Namely, Cure Egret/Windy: "Those who desecrate the Holy Fountains...", Cure Bloom/Bright: "...We're here to stop your cruel behavior!" Unlike the preceding series where the duo's hairstyle and coloring are not much changed, starting from "Splash★Star" and continued onto the succeeding series, their hair length, hairstyle, and coloring scheme have changed significantly, and the girls seem to grow a bit after they transform.
Like all other Precure members, the girls' magical outfits resemble a Lolita-alike dress that has no connection to their original clothing, and they always revert back to the way they were after their transformation has halted. Cure Bloom wears a deep pink and yellow dress, and the Flower symbol on Flappy's forehead appears on the back of her gloves. Cure Egret wears an ivory and pale blue dress, and the Bird symbol on Choppy's forehead also appears on the back of her gloves. The girls use these symbols for launching a group attack. Later, when they are upgraded into Cure Bright and Cure Windy, they still bear the Flower and Bird symbols from Flappy and Choppy on their gloves, and the girls still use these symbols for launching the Spiral Star Splash. Cure Bright has a yellow and green outfit. Cure Windy has a light pink and light blue outfit, and she's the only Precure member who has see-through parts (the sleeves) and over-the-shoulder ribbons on her outfit.
The girls' group attacks are somewhat similar to the attacks of the original "Futari wa Pretty Cure" series, all of which require them to summon the spirits of nature to attack the enemy. The first of Pretty Cure's attacks is PreCure Twin Stream Splash (トウイン ストリーム スプラッシュ, Touin Sutoriimu Supurasshu). This attack, performed by Cure Bloom and Cure Egret, is similar to the Marble Screw but it uses yellow and blue liquids rather than black and white lightning. To launch this attack, the duo calls upon the spirits of the Earth and the Sky. Energy gathers into their hands as they recite the incantation. The energy turns to yellow and blue liquids that come out of the Flower and Bird symbols on the girls' gloves. They force the liquids out after yelling "Splash!", turning them into strong liquid jets that enclose the foe and purify it.
In episode 24, they obtain the Spiral Ring Set when Mupu and Fupu jump into the Splash Commune, a device resembling a mini computer found under the Sky Tree after Saki and Mai return from The Fountain of Sky. Shaped like a heart, Bloom's spiral ring is a belt and Egret's spiral ring is a bracelet. There are three parts to this item: two blue-colored rings and the main part of the Spiral Ring. Here, they perform PreCure Spiral Heart Splash (スプイラル ハート スプラッシュ, Supairaru Haato Supurasshu), again using the same yellow and blue liquids, but it changes into what resembles a drill blade, surrounding the enemy. To launch this attack, the girls activate and turn their Spiral Rings, charge up by energy from the Earth and Sky, and recite their incantation; blue and yellow liquids come out of their hands and morph into a heart, and the two push out the liquids, submerging the foe in a blue and yellow sphere hanging over a liquid heart.
Starting from episode 30, Flappy and Choppy change into a new form called the Crystal Commune, which allows Saki and Mai to choose between transforming into Cure Bright/Cure Windy or Cure Bloom/Cure Egret. Here, Pretty Cure Diamond Cards are not needed anymore. Instead, the girls spin the top of the commune and its tip will glow in their image color. When they transform into Cure Bright and Cure Windy, they shout out different speeches in the middle of their transformation, specifically, "Illuminate (Follow) the future!" for Saki and "Carry the courage!" for Mai. Their challenge phrase remains the same. The dress design of the Bright/Windy form is similar to the Bloom/Egret form, but with a significantly different coloring scheme and the moon/wind symbols that appear on Mupu's and Fupu's foreheads also appear on their dresses. In their upgraded form, Cure Bright is blessed with the moon power from Mupu via Flappy and emits a yellow-green aura, and Cure Windy is blessed with the wind power from Fupu via Choppy and emits a pink aura. Cure Bright relates to the Sky while Cure Windy relates to the Earth. In addition to all fighting capabilities of Cure Bloom, Cure Bright can utilize the Light power (Hikari-yo) for defense (as a beam disc) and power blasts (as a beam cannon). Similarly, Cure Windy can utilize the Wind power (Kaze-yo) for power blasts (as a wind cannon). As Cure Bright and Cure Windy, they always need the Spiral Ring Set for launching a group attack.
As Cure Bright and Cure Windy, their signature attack is PreCure Spiral Star Splash (スプイラル スター スプラッシュ, Supairaru Sutaa Supurasshu), which extends from the Spiral Heart Splash. It also requires the use of Spiral Rings, which has become star-shaped in this case. This attack makes use of yellow-green and pink liquids instead of yellow and blue liquids. To launch this attack, the girls activate and turn their Spiral Rings, charge up by energy from the Moon and Wind, and recite their incantation; yellow-green and pink liquids come out of their hands and morph into a star, and the two push out the liquids, submerging the foe in a yellow-green and pink sphere hanging over a liquid star.
The girls' final attack is PreCure Spiral Heart Splash Star (スプイラル ハート スプラッシュ スター, Supairaru Haato Supurasshu Sutaa), which is actually the Spiral Heart Splash with the Star (Moon/Wind) powers injected into it, allowing all four powers to be used together and dramatically increasing the attack strength. The attack is launched by Cure Bloom and Cure Egret in tandem with Michiru and Kaoru, who carry the moon and wind powers from Mupu and Fupu. Gooyan admits that their attack feels like the big bang that had created the universe.
In the Pretty Cure Splash★Star movie, Pretty Cure Splash☆Star Tic-Tac Crisis Hanging by a Thin Thread! (Futari wa Precure Splash☆Star Tick Tack Kiki Ippatsu!), Saki and Mai as Cure Bright and Cure Windy have temporarily gained power from the Eternal Clock to defeat Sirlion with an upgraded version of the Spiral Star Splash. This attack resembles the regular Spiral Star Splash, except that Clock symbols appear in the background and their body exhibits a metallic glow when performing the attack.
In the Pretty Cure All Stars DX2 movie (Pretty Cure All Stars DX2: Light of Hope - Protect the Rainbow Jewel! / プリキュアオールスターズDX2 希望の光☆レインボージュエルを守れ！ Precure All Stars DX2: Kibō no Hikari— Rainbow Jewel o Mamore!), Saki and Mai gain power from the Rainbow Jewel and temporarily transform into Cure Rainbow Brighty Bloom and Cure Rainbow Windy Egret, which is a combined form of all four sources of spiritual powers plus a pair of small wings that all other Cures get.
Besides the aforementioned items, the girls also have a number of items which can be used in their civilian form. The Fairy Carafe is a storage for the Drops of Miracle, the latter of which is a colored small ball that fall from the defeated monster when the duo defeats an Uzainaa. The Drop of Miracle, whose color comes from the color of each day in one week of the Japanese Calendar, is needed to restore the ruined fountains. One ruined fountain will be restored for every seven Drops of Miracle in the Fairy Carafe. Lastly, the Pretty Cure Charm Pencase allow Saki and Mai to use the magical pen to write their wishes onto the magical paper so their wishes can be granted.
