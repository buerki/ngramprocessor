Introduction to the ngp

The ngp was put together during the course of work on my PhD thesis to help me study diachronic change in common expressions (i.e. in formulaic language) using corpus data. It is a branch of the well-established Ngram Statistics Package (nsp) and thus shares a significant portion of the code base with that project, specifically version 1.09 (by Ted Pedersen, Satanjeev Banerjee and collaborators, cf. -Banerjee 2003-) and 1.10 (a re-write of the nsp by Bjoern Wilmsmann, cf. -Wilmsmann 2007-).
If settings are used that exactly mirror settings in the nsp, identical output can be achieved. The ngp, however, is now a entirely separate package and does not interfere with installations of the nsp. For the benefit of those already familiar with the nsp, the main differences between the two software packages lie in the focus of the nsp on the calculation of statistical measures of association of listed n-grams (hence the ’statistics’ in the name), whereas the ngp focuses on the ability to process large(r) amounts of data on the sort of relatively low-spec (compared to supercomputers) personal computers that can be got hold of in humanities departments and on the processing of multilingual data, including data written in non-Roman script.
Also, the ngp does not include a statistics module (though under certain circumstances, it is possible to use the nsp statistics module on output data, see section 5). Instead, it makes it possible to track document frequency (i.e. the number of documents in which an n-gram occurs) in addition to overall frequency which is of vital importance for assessing the distribution of particular n-grams and their burstiness.
The key feature of the ngp is simple enough: to produce lists of n-grams.
