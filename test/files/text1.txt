The N-Gram Processor

The N-Gram Processor (ngp) is a open-source, free software package which produces and processes lists of word n-grams and their frequencies out of text files. Its users will typically be linguists working with corpus linguistic methods, but others may find its functions useful as well. This brief guide will introduce the reader to what the ngp is and how it works. 
It assumes basic familiarity with a UNIX-like operating system and a rudimentary understanding of how to run software using a command line interface such as is accessed in Linux or OS X through the application ’Terminal’, so only minimal guidance will be provided on such matters. This guide is structured as follows: in the next section, some background to the ngp is given, covering the history on the codebase of the ngp, as well as an introduction to the task of n-gram list creation and the key features of the ngp. Installation information, requirements in terms of soft- and hardware and the basic operation of the ngp is shown in section 3 using examples. Some more advanced features and their operation are introduced in section 4. Section 5 discusses compatibility with the Ngram Statistics Package -Banerjee 2003a- and the guide concludes with some final comments about n-grams.
